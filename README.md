# Cl0ud-s-Military-Clothing-Expansion-Market-Config
These files are made for my Namask server.  You will need to change pricing to suit your needs. You will also need to fix Min/Max as you see fit. Currently all items in these are set
to be infinite stock and no price fluctuation in the market when buying and selling. 
Bandanas are included, but from what I have experienced they are bugged for me. They did crash my server when bought, so be careful if you decide to put them in the market.

If you need .json files made for your mod, or someone else's I would be glad to put in the work for donations.

contact me on discord if you have any questions. Inner Circle discord:https://discord.gg/hmNegzc4
